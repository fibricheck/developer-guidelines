# Linting

### Linting

Linting is an automatic way to detect programmatic and code style errors.\
We use `eslint`, providing our own package `@qompium/eslint-config-q-react`&#x20;

Projects should not usually have extra rules. Whenever you want to add one, you should consider if this rule should be added to our company linter instead.
